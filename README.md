# Recursion

1. ***What is recursive method? what is an infinite recursion?***
```
recursive methods are methods which calls itself directly or indirectly.

if there is method named A and if it calls itself then 
it is called direct recursion

suppose if there is method named A and B , A invokes method B ,which in turn
calls method A this is called indirect recursion.

infinite recursions occurs when base case is not specified in a method
